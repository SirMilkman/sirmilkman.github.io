  Everything I Made In 2023
  <br><div class="date"><small>December 31, 2023</small> </div>
</h2>
  
<div class="blogText">
2023 is over! I made a lot of stuff and compiled it all here. A LOT of
      this is 1-2 day prototypes that never turned into anything. Get ready to
      see the same blue checkerboard and purple walls a lot hehe.
      <br /><br />
      Everything is ordered roughly by when they were made.
      <br /><br />
      P.S. I also made a list reviewing every game I've played this year. You
      can read it here.
      <br /><br />

      <h3>January:<br /></h3>

      <b> Fish Game</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/JtZZCnu.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />

      Made this when I was learning how to write shaders. Was never really
      intended to go anywhere, but its still cool.
      <br /><br />

      <h3>February:<br /></h3>

      <b> Shell Physics Test</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/Gxcvw7m.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />

      A little custom physics test with shells. I like how they pile up! I plan
      to use this in a project in the future.
      <br /><br />
      <br />
      <b>Explosion VFX</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/Mjssgtx.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      VFX Animation practice! Wanted to make an explosion effect that i could
      use in other games. You'll see it in a few other projects... including
      Solarkid where its really hard to find because i balanced the game poorly.
      <br /><br />

      <h3>March:</h3>

      <b>gOnner Idea With Frogrammer</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/7x2rgcT.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Made for a game jam with
      <a href="https://twitter.com/ms_frogrammer/">Frogrammer</a> but we ended
      up not finishing it. Frog continued the project a little more. You can see
      that
      <a
        href="https://twitter.com/ms_frogrammer/status/1642574354520129537/video/1"
        >here</a
      >
      <br /><br />

      <br />
      <b>Godot PSX Shader</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZsqPbd3.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Made this when I wanted to try learning Godot. That is a whole other story
      (I don't really like godot) Making this shader was a nice challenge.
      <br /><br />
      <br />
      <b>Wall Stabbing Platformer</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/YCUPbDh.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      I wish I could do something more with this because i love the style and
      the mechanics, but the controls are just too klunky to be fun :(
      <br /><br />

      <br />
      <b>Top Down Horror Game Take 1</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/Wrs2lRA.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      An iteration of a horror game i've wanted to make for a long time. I'm a
      sucker for top down games with raycasting.
      <br /><br />

      <h3>April:</h3>

      <b>Explosion Barrels</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/3W2IKRx.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      This was an idea I had deep into my spelunky obsession. I wanted to make a
      roguelike similar to it... that didn't go far.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Catbeats 2</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/pmjuPih.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      This one released! Its a silly music app I made for my friends to use. Its
      a sequel to a program I made last year called catbeats 1. Im pretty proud
      of this one.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Addrop</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/tYzVoEW.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Addrop also released! I'm so proud of this game. I still cant believe that
      I only made it in 3 hours. Like how on earth did I polish it this much.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>RTS Game</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/jb8fpff.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Started this when a friend challenged me to make a good RTS game. Turns
      out that I am bad at making good RTS games! I like the animation on the
      troops and trees.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <h3>May:</h3>
      <b>ZK2D</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/K35TpgY.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Not much to say about this! I made it in an hour as a love letter thing to
      the game ZK. Its just okay. Thats a lie... I hate it
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Parcel Punisher</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">

        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      This game won me first place for fun in ludum dare!!! I am in love with
      this visual style and gameplay of this game. Honestly its the perfect game
      for me. I love hotline miami and this is just everything i love about that
      game + a bit more.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Juicy VFX</b>
      <br /><br />

        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      A little particle test thats been lost to time... I accidentally deleted
      the project files :p
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Silly Platformer Sketch</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/7R7cDkw.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Just a platformer idea i made before bed. Never intended it to go
      anywhere, but the movement is really fun. Maybe it'll be something one
      day...
      <br /><br /><br />

      <h3>June:</h3>
      <b>Faith Clone</b>
      <br /><br />

        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      I played FAITH and I wanted to make FAITH. FAITH is a good game. You
      should also play FAITH.
      <br /><br /><br />

      <h3>July:</h3>
      <b>Midnight Hotswap Turbo</b>

      </div>
      <br /><br />
      This is my favorite game i've released this year. One of my only games
      that I actually play and enjoy. Something about it is just so fun :-) If
      you're only going to play 1 thing ive ever made, play this.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Game With Plant</b>

      <br /><br />
      A small game i was making with ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ²aka
      <a href="https://jakeyouh.itch.io">Jakeyouh.</a> It never went anywhere :(
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Computer Desktop</b>

      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Made this as a clone of Adam Pype's computer desktop game. Mostly to
      challenge myself! I'm really proud of it.

      <br /><br />
      This game is just lovely. The vibes are great and so is the music (thanks
      james!) lowresjam was one of the first jams ive finished that isnt 2-3
      days. It was waaaay too long. I took a camping trip to Yosemite during the
      jam and still finished.

      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Drill Sketch</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/BPCywqX.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Another evening prototype I made for maybe the brakeys jam, but didnt
      finish it because i didnt want to!
      <br /><br /><br />
      <h3>September:</h3>
      <b>Random Golf</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/b0zV3L2.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Made this as warmup for ludum dare! Randomly generated golf. Its not very
      good tho.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Car Building Game</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/Ma2EeC5.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      I worked on this for a bit but it became super complicated and bloated.
      Ill probably finish it someday... someday.......
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Ludum Dare First Idea</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/LMdCbHq.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      This was my original prototype for Ludum Dare. the theme was "Limited
      Space" and the idea was that you would combine elements to make humans and
      a civilization in "Limited Space" It was NOT fun!!!
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Solarkid Sacrifice</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">
          <img class="imgREAL" src="https://i.imgur.com/TsUHte5.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      This game is weird... A lot of people liked it, but personally i dont. I
      did a bad job at balancing it so you end up never seeing the fun weapons.
      Did you know that there is a bomb plant? Yeah! You never see it.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <h3>October:</h3>
      <b>Crow Hill</b>

      Released this one on halloween. Not much to say about it! Cool game.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <h3>November:</h3>
      <b>Softbody Suika</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">

        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      I was originally going to release this for money, but for a lot of
      reasons, I decided not to. I also lost interest with it because the genre
      felt like a very fleeting trend. Overall i'm glad I didnt finish this one.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Ray Reflection</b>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="photo">
        <div class="img">

      <br /><br />
      This was just me learning how laser reflection works.
      <br /><br /><br />

      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Made for Frogrammer's Remix Jam with
      <a href="https://kaboppel.itch.io/">Keboppel</a>. I wasn't able to finish
      it because of family stuff. <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Top Down Horror Game Take 2</b>

        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Another iteration of the horror game from earlier. I'm still actively
      working on it... Maybe youll see something from it soon......... or not!
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Paradise Blitz V</b>
      <br /><br />

        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Originally this started out as a project for paradise blitz, but it became
      pretty big. I really like this idea, but I dont really have time to finish
      it up right now :(

      <br /><br /><br />

      Made for the Paradise Secret Santa. It was NOT fun!!! Glad i pivoted the
      idea haha.

      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Puzzlebox Platformer</b>

      </div>
      <br /><br />
      Made for the confounding calendar. My first real attempt at making a
      sokabon puzzle. Super challenging to make, but really rewarding to finish.
      Puzzle is not spoiled in the gif!

      <br /><br /><br />

      Made for WAPORWAVE!!! Merry Christmas! Making this was an eye opening
      experience that I will not elaborate! Alex if you're reading this, you
      might know.

      <br /><br /><br />
      Thats it! We made it through 2023. Heres to making lots more games! and
