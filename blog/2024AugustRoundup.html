August is over! I released two games this month so ironically I didn't make as many prototypes as usual.
<br>On top of that, I started college so I've had less time to make things. 
<br><br>
Ok ok enough housekeeping lets look at the things.
<br>
  <br><br><b>Renegade Rally</b>
  <br>Made this in 2 weeks for Lowrez Jam 2024
  <br>I think this is one of my favorite games I've made. I'm very proud of it.
  <br>It placed 6th place overall!
  <br><br>You can play it <a href=" https://sirmilkman.itch.io/renegade-rally">here</a>

  <b>Gmtk 2024</b>
<br>I joined with <a href="https://team-bugulon.itch.io/">Team Bugulon</a> for GMTK 2024. We had some trouble finding an idea and I made 2 prototypes for ideas we didn't go with. 

<br><br><br><br> 
<b>Ultimate Chicken Horse Prototype</b>
<br>The idea for this one was a tower you placed blocks in freely and had to climb up. We didn't choose it because it would be hard do design.

<br><br><br><br> 
<b>Scaffolding Prototype</b>
<br>This one was my idea. You would have limited amount and types of scaffolding that you had to use to climb up a tower. We didn't go with it tho :(

<br><br><br><br> 
<b>Gatotag</b>
<br>The final product! We made a platformer where you climb towers by placing down blocks.<br> 
<br> <br> Play <a href="https://team-bugulon.itch.io/gatotag">here</a> now OR ELSE!!!

<br><br><br><br> 
<b>(Bonus) Block editor</b>
<br>Since all of the blocks in Gatotag are saved as strings of numbers, I had to make an editor for our level designer to make them. <br> I really like making editors for my things, but this was my first time making one not just for me. Squp gave great feedback that helped a bunch. <br> Heres a clip of how it works!

  <br><br><br><br> 
<b>Mario Bros 2 Idea</b>
<br>A small platformer prototype based on Mario Bros 2.
<br> It feels bad to control.
