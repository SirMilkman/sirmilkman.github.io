Been writing these roundups personally for about 4 months, but thought it would be nice to store them here from now on!
Essentially this is a list of everything I've made and what they might become.
<br><br>
Softbody Suika Game:<br>
First thing I worked on is a softbody suika game idea.
Still working on this actively.
