    <div class="pageTitle"> Everything I Made In 2023 <i>December 31, 2023</i></div>
    
    <p>2023 is over! I made a lot of stuff and compiled it all here. A LOT of this is 1-2 day prototypes that never turned into anything. Get ready to see the same blue checkerboard and purple walls a lot hehe.<br /></p>

<p>Everything is ordered roughly by when they were made. <br /></p>

<p>P.S. I also made a list reviewing every game I’ve played this year. You can read it <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--CWWi3p6P6uNvng7BCrrxto_r1J4G03bciz9XIepmI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
 <br /><br /></p>

<h2 id="january-">January <br /></h2>
<p><br />
<strong>Fish Game</strong><br />
Made this when I was learning how to write shaders. Was never really intended to go anywhere, but its still cool. 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/fish.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="february-">February <br /></h2>
<p><br />
<strong>Shell Physics Test</strong><br />
A little custom physics test with shells. I like how they pile up! I plan to use this in a project in the future. 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/shells.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Explosion VFX</strong><br />
VFX Animation practice! Wanted to make an explosion effect that i could use in other games. You’ll see it in a few other projects… including Solarkid where its really hard to find because i balanced the game poorly. 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/exp.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="march-">March <br /></h2>
<p><br />
<strong>gOnner Idea With Frogrammer</strong><br />
Made for a game jam with <a href="https://x.com/ms_frogrammer/">Frogrammer</a> but we ended up not finishing it. Frog continued the project a little more. You can see that <a href="https://x.com/ms_frogrammer/status/1642574354520129537">here!</a>
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/frogGame.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Godot PSX Shader</strong><br />
Made this when I wanted to try learning Godot. That is a whole other story (I don’t really like godot) Making this shader was a nice challenge.
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/psx.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Wall Stabbing Platformer</strong><br />
I wish I could do something more with this because i love the style and the mechanics, but the controls are just too klunky to be fun :( 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/stab.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Top Down Horror Game Take 1</strong><br />
An iteration of a horror game i’ve wanted to make for a long time. I’m a sucker for top down games with raycasting. 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/horror1.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="april-">April <br /></h2>
<p><br />
<strong>Explosion Barrels</strong><br />
This was an idea I had deep into my spelunky obsession. I wanted to make a roguelike similar to it… that didn’t go far. 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/explosion.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Catbeats 2</strong><br />
This one released! Its a silly music app I made for my friends to use. Its a sequel to a program I made last year called catbeats 1. Im pretty proud of this one. <br /></p>

<p><a href="https://sirmilkman.itch.io/catbeats-2">Check it out!</a>
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/catbeats.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Addrop</strong><br />
Addrop also released! I’m so proud of this game. I still cant believe that I only made it in 3 hours. Like how on earth did I polish it this much. <br /></p>

<p><a href="https://sirmilkman.itch.io/addrop">Play it here</a>
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/addrop.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>RTS Game</strong><br />
Started this when a friend challenged me to make a good RTS game. Turns out that I am bad at making good RTS games! I like the animation on the troops and trees. 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/RTS.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="may-">May <br /></h2>
<p><br />
<strong>ZK2D</strong><br />
Not much to say about this! I made it in an hour as a love letter thing to the game ZK. Its just okay. Thats a lie… I hate it <br /></p>

<p><a href="https://sirmilkman.itch.io/zk2d">Play it here</a>
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/zk2d.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Parcel Punisher</strong><br />
This game won me first place for fun in ludum dare!!! I am in love with this visual style and gameplay of this game. Honestly its the perfect game for me. I love hotline miami and this is just everything i love about that game + a bit more. <br /></p>

<p><a href="https://sirmilkman.itch.io/parcel-punish">Play it here</a>
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/parcel.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Juicy VFX</strong><br />
A little particle test thats been lost to time… I accidentally deleted the project files :p 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/particles.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Silly Platformer Sketch</strong><br />
Just a platformer idea i made before bed. Never intended it to go anywhere, but the movement is really fun. Maybe it’ll be something one day…
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/platformer.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="july-">July <br /></h2>
<p><br />
<strong>Midnight Hotswap Turbo</strong><br />
This is my favorite game i’ve released this year. One of my only games that I actually play and enjoy. Something about it is just so fun :-) If you’re only going to play 1 thing ive ever made, play this. <br /></p>

<p><a href="https://sirmilkman.itch.io/midnighthotswapturbo">Play it here</a>
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/mht.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Game With Plant</strong><br />
A small game i was making with 🌱🌿🌲aka <a href="https://jakeyouh.itch.io/">Jakeyouh</a>. It never went anywhere :( 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/plant.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Computer Desktop</strong><br />
Made this as a clone of Adam Pype’s computer desktop game. Mostly to challenge myself! I’m really proud of it. 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/desktop.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="august-">August <br /></h2>
<p><br />
<strong>Midnight Hotswap Turbo</strong><br />
This game is just lovely. The vibes are great and so is the music (thanks james!) lowresjam was one of the first jams ive finished that isnt 2-3 days. It was waaaay too long. I took a camping trip to Yosemite during the jam and still finished.  <br /></p>

<p><a href="https://sirmilkman.itch.io/rad-rabbit-mad-dash">Play it here</a>
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/mht.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Drill Sketch</strong><br />
Another evening prototype I made for maybe the brakeys jam, but didnt finish it because i didnt want to! . 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/drill.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="september-">September <br /></h2>
<p><br />
<strong>Random Golf</strong><br />
Made this as warmup for ludum dare! Randomly generated golf. Its not very good tho.
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/golf.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Car Building Game</strong><br />
I worked on this for a bit but it became super complicated and bloated. Ill probably finish it someday… someday……. 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/piggies.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Ludum Dare First Idea</strong><br />
This was my original prototype for Ludum Dare. the theme was “Limited Space” and the idea was that you would combine elements to make humans and a civilization in “Limited Space” It was NOT fun!!! 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/ldProto.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Solarkid Sacrifice</strong><br />
This game is weird… A lot of people liked it, but personally i dont. I did a bad job at balancing it so you end up never seeing the fun weapons. Did you know that there is a bomb plant? Yeah! You never see it.  <br /></p>

<p><a href="https://sirmilkman.itch.io/solarkid-sacrifice">Play it here</a>
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/solarkid.gif" /><br /><br />

<h2 id="october-">October <br /></h2>
<p><br />

<h2 id="november-">November <br /></h2>
<p><br />
<strong>Softbody Suika</strong><br />
I was originally going to release this for money, but for a lot of reasons, I decided not to. I also lost interest with it because the genre felt like a very fleeting trend. Overall i’m glad I didnt finish this one. 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/suika.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Ray Reflection</strong><br />
This was just me learning how laser reflection works. 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/refl.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Remix Jam</strong><br />
Made for Frogrammer’s Remix Jam with <a href="https://kaboppel.itch.io/">Keboppel</a>. I wasn’t able to finish it because of life stuff.</p>

<p><br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/snake.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Top Down Horror Take 2</strong><br />
Another iteration of the horror game from earlier. I’m still actively working on it… Maybe youll see something from it soon……… or not! 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/horror2.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Paradise Blitz V</strong><br />
Originally this started out as a project for paradise blitz, but it became pretty big. I really like this idea, but I dont really have time to finish it up right now :( 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/blitzV.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="december-">December <br /></h2>
<p><br />
<strong>Ship Game</strong><br />
Made for the Paradise Secret Santa. It was NOT fun!!! Glad i pivoted the idea haha. 
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/turnSpaceship.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Puzzlebox Platformer</strong><br />
Made for the confounding calendar. My first real attempt at making a sokabon puzzle. Super challenging to make, but really rewarding to finish. Puzzle is not spoiled in the gif! <br /></p>

<p><a href="https://sirmilkman.itch.io/puzzleblock-platformer">Play it here</a>
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/puzzlebox.gif" /><br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Wyrm Climb</strong><br />
Made for WAPORWAVE!!! Merry Christmas! Making this was really really fun! Also learned a lot about my creative process in this one. <br /></p>

<p><a href="https://sirmilkman.itch.io/wyrm-climb">Play it here</a>
<br /><br /><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/wyrmclimb.gif" /><br /><br />
