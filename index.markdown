#### I'm sirmilkman. Welcome to my website! ####

I'm a programmer, artist and game developer making freeware games while I attend college. 
I've been making games for about 5 years using Gamemaker and Pico-8.
I particularly enjoy making fast-paced action games with lots of particle effects and explosions.

This site serves as a mostly-complete catalogue of everthing I've made. You can use the 
navigation menu on the left to look through my various things.
