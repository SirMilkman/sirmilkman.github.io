Been writing these roundups personally for about 4 months, but thought it would be nice to store them here from now on! Essentially this is a list of everything I've made and what they might become. <br><br>



**Softbody Suika Game**<br>
First thing I worked on is a softbody suika game idea. Still working on this actively.

<br>

**Horror Game**<br>
Worked on this at the beginning of the month. Put it on the backburner because its larger than I have time to make right now.

**Mockups**<br>
Been trying to get better at pixel art this month! Here are some tiny game mockups I've made.

<br>

**Laser Refection**<br>
This one was just a fun test! Made it in a few hours. Probably not going anywhere tho... maybe a golf game... maybe.. no! not now!

**Paradise Blitz V**<br>
Originally this started out as a project for paradise blitz, but it became pretty big. I really like this idea, but I dont really have time to finish it up right now :(

<br>

**Remix Jam**<br>
Made a prototype for Frogrammer's Remix Jam before I had to step away because of irl stuff. Oh well!
