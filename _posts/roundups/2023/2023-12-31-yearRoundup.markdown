2023 is over! I made a lot of stuff and compiled it all here. A LOT of this is 1-2 day prototypes that never turned into anything. Get ready to see the same blue checkerboard and purple walls a lot hehe.<br>

Everything is ordered roughly by when they were made. <br>

P.S. I also made a list reviewing every game I've played this year. You can read it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--CWWi3p6P6uNvng7BCrrxto_r1J4G03bciz9XIepmI/edit?usp=sharing).
 <br><br>

## January <br>
<br>
**Fish Game**<br>
Made this when I was learning how to write shaders. Was never really intended to go anywhere, but its still cool. 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/fish.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

## February <br>
<br>
**Shell Physics Test**<br>
A little custom physics test with shells. I like how they pile up! I plan to use this in a project in the future. 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/shells.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Explosion VFX**<br>
VFX Animation practice! Wanted to make an explosion effect that i could use in other games. You'll see it in a few other projects... including Solarkid where its really hard to find because i balanced the game poorly.

<br>

## March <br>
<br>
**gOnner Idea With Frogrammer**<br>
Made for a game jam with [Frogrammer](https://x.com/ms_frogrammer/) but we ended up not finishing it. Frog continued the project a little more. You can see that [here!](https://x.com/ms_frogrammer/status/1642574354520129537)
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/frogGame.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Godot PSX Shader**<br>
Made this when I wanted to try learning Godot. That is a whole other story (I don't really like godot) Making this shader was a nice challenge.
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/psx.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Wall Stabbing Platformer**<br>
I wish I could do something more with this because i love the style and the mechanics, but the controls are just too klunky to be fun :( 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/stab.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Top Down Horror Game Take 1**<br>
An iteration of a horror game i've wanted to make for a long time. I'm a sucker for top down games with raycasting. 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/horror1.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

## April <br>
<br>
**Explosion Barrels**<br>
This was an idea I had deep into my spelunky obsession. I wanted to make a roguelike similar to it... that didn't go far. 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/explosion.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Catbeats 2**<br>
This one released! Its a silly music app I made for my friends to use. Its a sequel to a program I made last year called catbeats 1. Im pretty proud of this one. <br>

[Check it out!](https://sirmilkman.itch.io/catbeats-2)
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/catbeats.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Addrop**<br>
Addrop also released! I'm so proud of this game. I still cant believe that I only made it in 3 hours. Like how on earth did I polish it this much. <br>

[Play it here](https://sirmilkman.itch.io/addrop)
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/addrop.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**RTS Game**<br>
Started this when a friend challenged me to make a good RTS game. Turns out that I am bad at making good RTS games! I like the animation on the troops and trees. 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/RTS.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

## May <br>
<br>
**ZK2D**<br>
Not much to say about this! I made it in an hour as a love letter thing to the game ZK. Its just okay. Thats a lie... I hate it <br>

[Play it here](https://sirmilkman.itch.io/zk2d)
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/zk2d.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Parcel Punisher**<br>
This game won me first place for fun in ludum dare!!! I am in love with this visual style and gameplay of this game. Honestly its the perfect game for me. I love hotline miami and this is just everything i love about that game + a bit more. <br>

[Play it here](https://sirmilkman.itch.io/parcel-punish)

<br>

**Juicy VFX**<br>
A little particle test thats been lost to time... I accidentally deleted the project files :p 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/particles.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Silly Platformer Sketch**<br>
Just a platformer idea i made before bed. Never intended it to go anywhere, but the movement is really fun. Maybe it'll be something one day...
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/platformer.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

## July <br>
<br>
**Midnight Hotswap Turbo**<br>
This is my favorite game i've released this year. One of my only games that I actually play and enjoy. Something about it is just so fun :-) If you're only going to play 1 thing ive ever made, play this. <br>

[Play it here](https://sirmilkman.itch.io/midnighthotswapturbo)
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/mht.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Game With Plant**<br>
A small game i was making with ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ²aka [Jakeyouh](https://jakeyouh.itch.io/). It never went anywhere :( 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/plant.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Computer Desktop**<br>
Made this as a clone of Adam Pype's computer desktop game. Mostly to challenge myself! I'm really proud of it. 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/desktop.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

## August <br>
<br>
**Midnight Hotswap Turbo**<br>
This game is just lovely. The vibes are great and so is the music (thanks james!) lowresjam was one of the first jams ive finished that isnt 2-3 days. It was waaaay too long. I took a camping trip to Yosemite during the jam and still finished.  <br>

<br>

**Drill Sketch**<br>
Another evening prototype I made for maybe the brakeys jam, but didnt finish it because i didnt want to! . 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/drill.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

## September <br>
<br>
**Random Golf**<br>
Made this as warmup for ludum dare! Randomly generated golf. Its not very good tho.
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/golf.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Car Building Game**<br>
I worked on this for a bit but it became super complicated and bloated. Ill probably finish it someday... someday....... 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/piggies.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Ludum Dare First Idea**<br>
This was my original prototype for Ludum Dare. the theme was "Limited Space" and the idea was that you would combine elements to make humans and a civilization in "Limited Space" It was NOT fun!!! 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/ldProto.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Solarkid Sacrifice**<br>
This game is weird... A lot of people liked it, but personally i dont. I did a bad job at balancing it so you end up never seeing the fun weapons. Did you know that there is a bomb plant? Yeah! You never see it.  <br>

[Play it here](https://sirmilkman.itch.io/solarkid-sacrifice)

<br>

## November <br>
<br>
**Softbody Suika**<br>
I was originally going to release this for money, but for a lot of reasons, I decided not to. I also lost interest with it because the genre felt like a very fleeting trend. Overall i'm glad I didnt finish this one. 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/suika.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Ray Reflection**<br>
This was just me learning how laser reflection works. 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/refl.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Remix Jam**<br>
Made for Frogrammer's Remix Jam with [Keboppel](https://kaboppel.itch.io/). I wasn't able to finish it because of life stuff.
 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/snake.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Top Down Horror Take 2**<br>
Another iteration of the horror game from earlier. I'm still actively working on it... Maybe youll see something from it soon......... or not! 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/horror2.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Paradise Blitz V**<br>
Originally this started out as a project for paradise blitz, but it became pretty big. I really like this idea, but I dont really have time to finish it up right now :( 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/blitzV.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

## December <br>
<br>
**Ship Game**<br>
Made for the Paradise Secret Santa. It was NOT fun!!! Glad i pivoted the idea haha. 
<br><br><img class="blogImg myImg" src="/assets/blog/2023/turnSpaceship.gif" /><br><br>
<br>

**Puzzlebox Platformer**<br>
Made for the confounding calendar. My first real attempt at making a sokabon puzzle. Super challenging to make, but really rewarding to finish. Puzzle is not spoiled in the gif! <br>
