First month of 2024! This month I didnt do much.<br>
Heres what I did do tho:<br><br>



**File System Game**<br>

Didnt really know what I wanted this to become, but i'm really proud of how stylish it is. It also can function as a file browser and read .txt files!

<br>

**Box Kicker**<br>
Made this in like 15 minutes because I was feeling burnt out. Not very interesting.

<br>

**Minesweeper**<br>
This is just regular minesweeper. I made this because I wanted to play minesweeper but didn't have internet (I still dont at the time of writing).

**Dreadwood Hunter**<br>
January's game! Made in 8 hours. I'm really proud of the aiming system. I wanted to replicated 3d "aiming down sights" in 2d and think I nailed it. [Play it](https://sirmilkman.itch.io/dreadwood-hunter) and tell me what you think.
