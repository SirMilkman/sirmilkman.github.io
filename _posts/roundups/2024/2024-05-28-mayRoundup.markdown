Woah! I missed a month! I've been too busy to sit down and write a post lately.<br>
Well lets not waste any more time. Heres the biggest thing! <br><br>


**Flywrench Spaceship**<br>
This one is a top down flywrench type game!<br>
I like the concept, but don't really want to design a lot of levels for it.

<br>


Okay with that out of the way, here are some prototypes.

<br>

**Factory Game**<br>
A small experiment with gamemaker's physics! Was going to be a game where you explore a moving factory, but the idea didn't really excite me enough to become any bigger than it is.

<br>

**Joystick Ship Controller**<br>
This one is really small. I wanted to try making an onscreen joystick that controlled a ship.

<br>

**Spaceship Builder**<br>
Another small 1-2 hour thing. A spaceship builder with somewhat accurate physics.

<br>

**(Bonus) Rapidoodle**<br>
Made for the bullet hell jam 2024 in 4ish days. I see colors when <br>I close my eyes! <br>
