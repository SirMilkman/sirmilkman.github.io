June is over and its roundup time!<br>
I didn't do much this month because I took a vacation!<br><br>


**Mooncat**<br>
I've been working on a little gameboy inspired platformer!
Although I hate the term, I would probably call this my "dream game." Unfortunately, it probably won't release for a while because I super overscoped it haha.

**Room Camera System**<br>
Every time I get burnt out, I go back to making the same shooty gun game!

**Desert Game**<br>
Based on a dream of a game I had. In the dream you walked around and got pushed around by sandstorms.
I think there were towers you platformed up and the sandstorms knocked you off.

**Mockups!**<br>
I've been trying to get better at pixelart recently.
Here are some of my favorite pieces I've done.

It's a weird DSI inspired bullet hell game.<br>
