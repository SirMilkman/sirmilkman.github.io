August is over! I released two games this month so ironically I didn't make as many prototypes as usual.
On top of that, I started college so I've had less time to make things.

Ok ok enough housekeeping lets look at the things.


**Renegade Rally**<br>
Made this in 2 weeks for Lowrez Jam 2024
I think this is one of my favorite games I've made. I'm very proud of it.
It placed 6th place overall!

You can play it here
<br><br><br>
**Gmtk 2024** <br>
I joined with Team Bugulon for GMTK 2024. We had some trouble finding an idea and I made 2 prototypes for ideas we didn't go with.
<br><br>

**Ultimate Chicken Horse Prototype**<br>
The idea for this one was a tower you placed blocks in freely and had to climb up. We didn't choose it because it would be hard do design.

<br>

**Scaffolding Prototype**<br>
This one was my idea. You would have limited amount and types of scaffolding that you had to use to climb up a tower. We didn't go with it tho :(

<br>

**Gatotag**<br>
The final product! We made a platformer where you climb towers by placing down blocks.

Play here now OR ELSE!!!
<br><br>

**(Bonus) Block editor**<br>
Since all of the blocks in Gatotag are saved as strings of numbers, I had to make an editor for our level designer to make them.
I really like making editors for my things, but this was my first time making one not just for me. Squp gave great feedback that helped a bunch.
Heres a clip of how it works!

<br>

**Mario Bros 2 Idea**<br>
A small platformer prototype based on Mario Bros 2.
It feels bad to control.
