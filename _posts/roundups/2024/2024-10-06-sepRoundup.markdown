Oops is october 6th sorry im late. I started a pretty big project right when the month started. <br><br>

Video games! Still not much because of college. <br><br>

**Car prototype**<br>
Made for a personal 1 hour jam<br>
Its not very fun so I didn't really expand on it at all

<br>

**Code editor**<br>
I made a code editor from scratch half for fun half for a game.
Turns out it's really hard to make a text editor! Theres so much you dont think about.

<br>

**Undertale Battle System**<br>
Spent an evening prototyping a battle system for a little undertale fan game I was going to make with friends.
Unfortunately it fell through. I might recycle this for something original tho.

**1 Hour Swing Game**<br>
Did this for a 1 hour jam with some of my friends.<br>
The theme was 'swing' so you swing between blocks.

**Drillship TURBO**<br>
This was originally a 1 hour prototype that I expanded into a full game.<br>
I'm so proud of this one its so fun.<br>

Its out! And you can [play it here](https://sirmilkman.itch.io/drillship-turbo)
