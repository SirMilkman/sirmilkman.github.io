<br>November is over! <br>
Wow! I'm actually on time this time and not writing this at midnight! <br>
Busy month school-wise so I didn't make much, but there is some stuff! <br><br>


**Katana Zero Prototype**<br>
Made this as a warmup for a little game jam I did with some friends! <br> Im proud of the slash animation.

<br>

**Music**<br>
[sarn](https://saturnyoshi.itch.io/) and [oroshibu](https://oroshibu.itch.io/) got me into making music and I decided to put some of it up on soundcloud this month. <br> You can listen to it [here](https://soundcloud.com/808093).
<br><br>
<br>

**Top Down Shooter**<br>
Very boring top down shooter about which I have nothing to say. <br> I like the kill effect tho.

<br>

**Deckbuilder Map**<br>
I saw a [post](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/979634396376211466/1312546626178646117/image.png?ex=674ce3cd&is=674b924d&hm=10d2abf31308b7b8722afba5d44d05b5ef25e95a0122e90c78ffc818804c5487&) about deckbuilder maps and wanted to try to make one. <br> I like the weird 3d one.

Little platformer I made one evening for fun.<br>
Maybe I'll finish it.

**16x16 Game**<br>
16x16 game in 16 minutes! <br> I nominate anyone who's reading this to also do this challenge. Its very fun

<br>

**Python Asteroids Clone**<br>
An asteroids clone I made in an evening with Zach Barth's [ultra minimalist framework](https://www.trashworldnews.com/ultra-minimalist/) <br>
Oh man I almost love it so much, but theres a few things I don't really want to deal with haha. <br>
I'm probably going to try more frameworks in the future.
