Octobers over!<br> By far my most productive month release-wise and by far my least productive month making-stuff-i-didnt-release-wise <br><br>


**Modular Game**<br>
I only made 1 prototype this month! It's a modular wires math game.

**Critter Switcher**<br>
I colabed with the amazing [Torcado](https://x.com/torcado) and the equally amazing [keestak](https://x.com/Keestak) for ludum dare!
We made a little brough-like where you play as various animals. I only did art for this.

**Mouse Snake**<br>
Made this for my annual halloween game jam! Where I make whatever I want after I finish handing out candy.
I'm pretty proud of this one - I'm glad I made 5 modes in such a short time.

**2 Week Megamix**<br>
This is my big project!!!! I made 1 game every day for 2 weeks.
I probably have a blog post coming eventually about how that went.
The TLDR was it was super fun and I learned a lot about how I make stuff!
For now heres some gifs and a [link to go play it](https://sirmilkman.itch.io/two-week-megamix)
