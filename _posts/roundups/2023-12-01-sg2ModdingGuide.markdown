# Installing the XDelta file:

**Step 1:**
Get Delta Patcher

Download [Delta Patcher](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/) and unzip the folder.
I use version 3.0.1, but I don't think the version matters.
<br>

**Step 2:**
Find your 'data.win' file.

You can find this file easily by navigating to it on steam.
Right-click on Samruai Gunn 2 and navigate: **Manage > Browse Local Files**

Find the file called 'data' or 'data.win' and make a backup somewhere in another folder. 
<br>

**Step 3:**
Patch in the XDelta

Open Delta Patcher and click the file icon for the 'Original File' category.
Locate and select the 'data.win' file. 

Click the file icon for the 'XDelta Patch' category.
Select the XDelta File containing the mod from your downloads folder.

Click Apply Patch

**The collisions for the modded maps should now work.**

# Installing the setdresses:

**Step 1:**
Launch SG2 and on the title screen press F7.
This should bring up their setdress editor. 
Click the 'Save' button in the upper left corner and close the game.

This should have created a 'Levels' folder in appdata. Locate that.
It can be usually found at: **C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\SamuraiGunn2\data\levels**

**Step 2:**
Unzip the 'Setdresses' folder and place the loose '.sglvl' files into the 'Levels' folder.

**Step 3:**
Launch the game and load one of the modded levels. If everything worked correctly it should be playable!

# Bonus World

On the title screen type the command **/makelevelthumbnails**
This generates new thumbnails for all the levels.

The thumbnails it generates are stored at: **C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\SamuraiGunn2\data\levels\screenshots**

<br>
# Uninstalling A Mod

Uninstalling is pretty simple. Just remove the '.sglvl' files from the 'Levels' folder and drag your backup data.win into where the game's local files are stored.

If you forgot to make or lost your backup, you can reset the game's files by right-clicking on Samurai Gunn 2 on Steam and navigating:
<br>**Properties... > Installed Files > Verify integrity of game files**
